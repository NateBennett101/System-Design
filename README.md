# System-Design

The DriverPass project was about a hypothetical client, DriverPass, and designing them a system for their driver education platform. They wanted a platform that could help newer drivers pass their driving test. One thing that I think I might have done well is designing the various diagrams and making them decently clear to understand. One thing that I might revise is the sequence diagram, as the login options could be a bit confusing. I implemented things that DriverPass required, like a way for users to reset their password. Listening to a client's requirements can be very important because a well taken care of client can lead to potentially more future business. I approach designing software by first trying to really understand the project and what the potential client might want before development. This is because I donâ€™t want to end up designing something different to what the client might desire, after that I might try and keep the client in the loop to further try and ensure that the project is what they might want. Some techniques and or strategies that I might use in the future is frequent meetings with both the potential client and the development team.
